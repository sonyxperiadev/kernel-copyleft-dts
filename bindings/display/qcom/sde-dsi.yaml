      a particular "type" of DSI module. The module "types"
      can be "core", "ctrl", and "phy". Within the same type,
      there can be more than one instance of this binding,
      in which case the entry would be appended with the

  qcom,mdss-mdp-transfer-time-us:
    description: |
      Specifies the dsi transfer time for command mode
      panels in microseconds. Driver uses this number to adjust
      the clock rate according to the expected transfer time.
      Increasing this value would slow down the mdp processing
      and can result in slower performance.
      Decreasing this value can speed up the mdp processing,
      but this can also impact power consumption.
      As a rule this time should not be higher than the time
      that would be expected with the processing at the
      dsi link rate since anyways this would be the maximum
      transfer time that could be achieved.
      If ping pong split enabled, this time should not be higher
      than two times the dsi link rate time.
      If the property is not specified, then the default value is 14000 us.
